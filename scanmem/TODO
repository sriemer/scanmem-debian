Current
=======
* option: whether to search in readonly regions
* reduce memory consumption (e.g. OVaMI padding)
* completely centralize the printing in `show_message`, so that printing to
  some other output stream is easy to add

* see: https://github.com/scanmem/scanmem/issues for further TODOs

Future
======
* use PT_IO on freebsd, instead of PT_READ/WRITE_D
* add working freebsd support
* in targetmem.c, check return value of allocate_enough_to_reach everywhere
* search for values in files? (eg saved state)
* macro support
* automatically support zero and one based values.
